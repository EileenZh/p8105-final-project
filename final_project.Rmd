Anything that inspired you, such as a paper, a web site, or something we discussed in class.
#Initial questions:
What questions are you trying to answer? How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?
#Data: 
Source: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Jobs/kpav-sd4t/data
Scrape:We doWnloaded the data set from the website and the original data set contains 3174 job information. We selected data with information about work location, job category, preferred skills and full/part time. We want to use Google Map to get longtitute and latitute from work locations. Since the Google map has a limit of 2500 observation one time, we selected first 2500 observations from the data set.
Cleaning:
1. Merged job category if they are the same kind but just have different names. Finally we got 12 kinds of job categories.  
2. Unified salary unit to "Annual" and recalculated the salary range and average salary.
